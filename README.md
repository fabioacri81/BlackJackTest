# BlackJackTest
Blackjack test application

BlackJackTest has been created as part of an iOS game test.
Has been done in 3 days, working a few hours a day, it involves :
CoreData, some UIKit animations.

The game is pretty straightforward based on the classic BlackJack cards game, the state of the game is saved and resumed through Core Data.
A quick and simple text instruction will come up for every round ending.

The graphic is not super, it's a combination of given assets with some internet free stock images, and of course the test is more based on getting the game working rather than on nice cosmetic look.
